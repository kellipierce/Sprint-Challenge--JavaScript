1. Briefly compare and contrast .forEach & .map (2-3 sentences max)

.forEach does not return anything; it calls a provided function on each element in the array.
.map calls a provided function as well, but .map returns values and actually returns a new Array of the same size.


2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.

Callback - functions that are passed into other functions as arguments
Higher order function - is a type of callback function that takes in a function as a parameter and executes a function when called with
a function as the argument.


3. What is closure?

A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables.


4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

Window/Global Object Binding - the value of "this" will be the window/console object when in the global scope
Implicit Binding - the object before the dot is "this" whenever an earlier dot calls a function
New Binding - "this" refers to the identified instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function whenever one is used
Explicit Binding - "this" is clearly defined when we use JS call or apply
